# Copilot Instructions for Java 21

## Primitive Types Preference
When developing in Java 21, prefer using primitive types over wrapper classes whenever possible. This not only improves performance but also reduces memory overhead.

## Zero-Dependency Design
Aim for a zero-dependency design in your Java applications. This approach minimizes external libraries usage, leading to better maintainability and simpler builds.

## Eager Parsing
Utilize eager parsing techniques for processing input data. Eager parsing can improve performance by reducing latency in data handling and processing.

## Immutable Value Objects
Favor immutable value objects in your design. Immutable objects enhance the reliability and robustness of your code, making it easier to reason about state changes and concurrency issues.
